    "The provided Python code snippet processes data stored in a JSON format to prepare it for training a chatbot model. Here's an overview of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading Data:**\n",
    "   - The code begins by opening a JSON file named `chatbot_data.json` and loading its contents into a Python dictionary named `data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Preparing Training Data:**\n",
    "   - Two empty lists, `training_sentences` and `training_labels`, are initialized to store training data.\n",
    "   - Another empty list, `responses`, is initialized to store responses associated with each intent.\n",
    "   - The code iterates over each intent in the `data['content']` section.\n",
    "   - For each intent, it iterates over the patterns (training sentences) within that intent.\n",
    "   - It appends each pattern to the `training_sentences` list and its corresponding tag (intent label) to the `training_labels` list.\n",
    "   - Additionally, it appends the responses associated with the intent to the `responses` list.\n",
    "   - If the intent's tag is not already in the `labels` list, it adds the tag to the `labels` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculating Number of Classes:**\n",
    "   - After processing all intents, the code calculates the number of unique classes (intents) by taking the length of the `labels` list.\n",
    "   - The result is stored in the variable `num_classes`, which represents the number of distinct intents in the dataset.\n",

    "   - The `transform` method of the `LabelEncoder` object is applied to the `training_labels` list.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Model Architecture**:\n",
    "   - A `Sequential` model is instantiated, representing a linear stack of layers.\n",
    "   - The first layer added to the model is an `Embedding` layer, which maps integer indices to dense vectors of fixed size (`embedding_dim`). This layer converts the input sequences of word indices into dense vectors.\n",
    "   - `GlobalAveragePooling1D` layer is added to compute the average of the embeddings across all words in the document. This layer reduces the sequence of embeddings into a single vector.\n",
    "   - Two fully connected (`Dense`) layers with ReLU activation functions (`'relu'`) are added to introduce non-linearity and increase model complexity.\n",
    "   - The final `Dense` layer has `num_classes` neurons and uses a softmax activation function to output probabilities for each class.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Model Compilation**:\n",
    "   - The model is compiled using `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` as the loss function, suitable for integer-encoded target labels.\n",
    "   - The Adam optimizer (`'adam'`) is used for gradient descent optimization.\n",
    "   - `'accuracy'` is specified as the metric to monitor during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Summary**:\n",
    "   - The `summary` method is called to display a summary of the model architecture, including the type and shape of each layer, the number of parameters, and the total trainable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training**:\n",
    "   - The model is trained using the `fit` method, which takes the padded sequences (`padded_sequences`) as input features and the corresponding integer-encoded labels (`training_labels`).\n",
    "   - The number of training epochs (`epochs`) is set to 500.\n",
    "   - The training process updates the model's weights to minimize the specified loss function (sparse categorical cross-entropy) and maximizes the accuracy metric.\n",
    "\n",

    "This section of code defines various functions that handle different aspects of the chat window functionality. Let's break down what each function does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `get_location_data(ip_address)`: Retrieves location data based on the user's IP address.\n",
    "2. `get_entity(user_input)`: Uses spaCy to extract named entities from user input.\n",
    "3. `check_status(text)`: Checks for dates in the provided text and returns them.\n",
    "4. `get_news_from_klix()`, `get_news_from_cnn()`, `get_news_from_nyt()`: Retrieve news headlines from different sources.\n",
    "5. `get_news_output(array)`: Processes and displays news headlines.\n",
    "6. `get_random_joke(text)`: Retrieves a random joke based on specified keywords.\n",
    "7. `chat_position_refresh()`: Refreshes the chat position and sets focus on the user input.\n",
    "8. `split_sentence(sentence)`: Splits a sentence and extracts country names using spaCy.\n",
    "9. `find_country_by_substring(substring)`: Searches for a country name containing the specified substring.\n",
    "10. `get_wiki_info(names, user_input)`: Retrieves Wikipedia information based on detected named entities.\n",
    "11. `get_chat_output(text)`: Displays chat output messages with timestamps.\n",
    "12. `get_current_weather(api_key, found_city, trazeni_datum)`: Retrieves current weather data for a given city and date.\n",
    "13. `check_weather(api_key, found_city, date, text)`: Checks weather conditions based on specified criteria.\n",
    "14. `get_weather_info(api_key, found_city, date)`: Retrieves weather forecast data for a given city and date.\n",
    "15. `get_wiki_answer(text)`: Retrieves Wikipedia information for a given query.\n",
    "16. `send_message1(event=None)`: Processes user input, performs various actions based on keywords, and generates appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. `analyze_user_input(user_input, string)`: Analyzes the user's input to check if a specific string is present in it. It uses spaCy's natural language processing capabilities to tokenize the input text and compares each token with the provided string, ignoring case sensitivity. If the string is found, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. `check_if_subject(user_input)`: Checks if the user input contains a subject. It identifies the subject by searching for tokens with the dependency label \"nsubj\" (subject) and specific parts of speech (proper noun, noun, adjective, or pronoun). If a subject is found, it returns the text of the subject token; otherwise, it returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. `get_names(user_input)`: Extracts named entities (specifically, persons) from the user's input. It utilizes spaCy's named entity recognition (NER) capabilities to identify entities labeled as \"PERSON\" in the input text. It then cleans each detected name using the clean_name function and returns a list of cleaned names.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. `clean_name(text)`: Cleans a name by removing any tokens categorized as verbs. It tokenizes the input text using spaCy and retains only those tokens that are not verbs, joining them back into a cleaned string.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. `on_mouse_wheel(event)`: Handles the mouse wheel event, specifically scrolling the canvas of the chat window in response to the mouse wheel movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. `remove_placeholder(event)`: Removes the placeholder text (\"Write your message here...\") from the user input field when the field gains focus. It ensures that the placeholder text is cleared to allow the user to input their message without manual deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. `on_enter(event)`: Triggers the send_message1() function when the Enter key is pressed while focusing on the user input field. It allows the user to send their message by pressing Enter instead of clicking a send button.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. `ignore_enter(event)`: Prevents the default behavior of the Enter key when pressed, effectively ignoring the Enter key press event. It ensures that pressing Enter does not trigger any unintended actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. `update_scrollregion(event=None)`: Updates the scroll region of the canvas in response to changes in the chat window's size. It ensures that the scrolling functionality adapts dynamically to the chat window's dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions collectively manage the chat window's behavior, handling tasks such as fetching news, weather information, jokes, named entity recognition, and Wikipedia queries. They contribute to providing a dynamic and engaging conversational experience for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:**\n",
    "Before proceeding, ensure you have set up an API key for weather data access. Failure to do so may result in errors or restricted functionality.\n",
